    <h3>Why ZeW - IT ?</h3>
    <p>
      The world is sinking into the sea of waste. Every narrow nooks and corner of the streets are being piled up with waste.

      Currently, there is no system of automatic waste segregation or collection implemented at the commercial level.
      
      Also, no such system exits whose purpose is to collect, segregate, manage waste as well as monitoring the whole process with minimum space and that is capable of being implemented in the general public.</p>

    <h3>What is ZeW - IT ?</h3>
    <p>
      ZeW-IT is an IoT based automatic waste segregation and management system. It is capable of automatically collecting and segregating up to 6 different types of waste namely organic, plastic, e-waste, metallic, glass and paper as they enter the bin.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Converts biowaste to manure. The bin uses the converted manure and implants a seed , makes a pellet and gives it as a reward to the user. These can be planted by the user. It has the added benefit of being able to grow even if the user throws it away on the roadside.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The bin also measures the live status of the compartments.
      It alerts the driver when the bin is full, using an android application and sets the easiest route for the collection of the waste by the driver. 
      
      The consumer using an application can get reward points by dumping waste into our bin which can be redeemed for public transport or any other commercial purpose. Users can also navigate to the nearest bin by using this application and also view the status of the individual compartments.</p>

    <h3>Advantages of ZeW - IT</h3>
    <p>
      ZeW-IT is fully automated and hence the user doesnâ€™t need to worry about the selection of the type of waste that he puts into the bin. 
      The bin automatically detects the type of waste and puts it into the corresponding compartment. 
      This is done using artificial intelligence with an accuracy of 98%. 
      There is also a proper monitoring and reporting system within the app.</p>
